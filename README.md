# game_of_life_torch
"game_of_life_torch" is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life implemented in Python using the PyTorch library. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton, where the evolution of cells is simulated based on simple rules. This implementation leverages PyTorch for efficient computation and provides a visual representation of the evolving cell patterns.
